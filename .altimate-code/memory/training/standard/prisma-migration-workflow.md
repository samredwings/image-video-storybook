# Prisma Migration Workflow
- Always use `npx prisma migrate dev --name <description>` for schema changes
- The .env file with DATABASE_URL must exist in apps/api/
- After migration, always verify: check tables, enum values, and _prisma_migrations tracking
- Old manual SQL migrations should be backed up, not deleted
- Regenerate Prisma Client: npx prisma generate
